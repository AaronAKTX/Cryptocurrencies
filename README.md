# Cryptocurrencies

The goal of this project was to process, analyze and group data to create a classification system of cryptocurrency investments. The source data was not ideal so it needed to be preprocessed before it could be fit into machine learning models. The output groups were not known so an unsupervised model was selected to group the currencies. Visualizations were created to display the  groups/clusters created from the machine learning algorithm.
